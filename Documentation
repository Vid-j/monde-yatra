## Game Concept Document

Title: Monde Yatra (MY)

Monde Yatra is a single-player exploration game where the goal is to unlock as many locations as possible on the map. As the game expands, players may have the option to explore multiple worlds, choosing their path through a vast, interconnected universe.
The journey begins with the first location on the initial map, where players navigate through the landscape in search of hidden portals. Upon discovering the portal, they will be presented with a word puzzle related to the location. Clues to solve the puzzle are embedded within the environment, encouraging thorough exploration. Successfully solving the puzzle grants access to the next location, allowing players to progress further into the game.
The name Monde Yatra is derived from two languages: French and Sanskrit. Monde (French) means "world," while Yatra (Sanskrit) means "journey." Together, they symbolize an adventure of discovering and traversing different worlds.

## Concept Statement

A multi-world, map-based exploration game where players begin at an initial location and search for a portal tied to the world’s theme. The puzzles will be contextually relevant, asking players to identify landmarks, historical dates, or other details about the environment.
A map layer will guide players through the world’s locations, highlighting areas to explore and uncover. Each location will feature multiple portals, each leading to a different world, expanding the adventure.
The number of portals within a location will be found on the map. The number of locations connected to the current location will be equal to the number of portals found in the realm.
While the game has the potential to grow into a large-scale, ongoing epic, it will initially launch as a small-scale production, focusing on the core mechanics of exploration, puzzle-solving, and world discovery.
Game World Fiction
